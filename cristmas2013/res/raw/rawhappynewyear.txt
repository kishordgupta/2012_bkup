Christmas is a time when Christmas is a time when everybody wants his past forgotten and his present remembered.
What I don’t like about office Christmas parties is looking for a job the next day.

Christmas is not a time nor a season,but a state of mind.To cherish peace and goodwill,to be plenteous in mercy,is to have the real spirit of Christmas.

May the miracle of Christmas fill your heart with warmth and love.Merry Christmas! 

A Christmas candle is a lovely thing A Christmas candle is a lovely thing;It makes no noise at all,But softly gives itself away;While quite unselfish,it grows small.
