For the best mom
who always had a smile for me
I know we may be far apart right now
So here's a great big hug and kiss
Happy Mother's Day

When you feel you are alone in the crowd, 
When you think No.1 can understand you, 
When your love is rejected by others, 
& when you hate your Life, 
Just close your eyes, & see, her face who loves you
more than any 1 else, 
who care for you in loneliness, 
& dies when you cry. 
She is no 1, but your sweet loving mother. 
Love your mom first and always.

I take this opportunity to thank you for your immeasurable contribution to my life. 
Thank you Mom! And wish you a Very Happy Mother's Day!

Your Mother Bore You
For 9 Months ,
She Watched Her Feet
Swell, She Struggled To
Climb Stairs,
She Got Breathless Quick,
She Bore Excruciating Pain,
She Suffered Many Sleepless
Nights,
She Became Your Nurse, Your
Chef, Your Teacher, your
Cleaner, Your Launderette, Your
Friend.
She Struggled For You, But Not
Did She See It As A Struggle,
Not Once Did She Develop
Regrets After All This …
How Dare You Say Even
“UFF” To Her …
I LOVE MY MOTHER BEYOND LIMITS

7#7# .

“Happy Mother’s Day” means more
“Happy Mother’s Day” means more
than have a happy day.
Within those words lie lots of things
we never get to say.
It means I love you first of all,
Then thanks for all you do.
It means you mean a lot to me,
And that I honor you.
But most of all, I guess it means
That I am thinking of
Your happiness on this, your day,
With pleasure and with love.
My Mother, my friend so dear
Throughout my life you’re always near
A tender smile to guide my way
You’re the sunshine to light my day

What a mother I have?
What a mother I have?
Lovely, lonely, peaceful mother,
She loves and treats us equally,
Wow, what a mother I have!
When she talks, laughs, sings,
All feel happy and be quiet to hear it.
Her soft voice makes me happy.
What a mother I have?

Oh! she can be only my mother
I wake up and call her in the morning,
She is always there for the answering,
Always ran to help me when I fell,
And kiss that place to make it well,
She is the treasure of my life,
Who told me never to lie,
Sweetest voice god has given,
It is simply the sound of heaven,
Fulfill my wishes these and others,
Oh! she can be only my mother.

A mother’s work is never done
A mother’s work is never done
She works from morning until dawn
She spreads her love
And keeps you warm
But only once a year we say
Mother we wish you “Happy Mothers Day”
Why not and all throughout the year?
We do think of our mother dear
And help her with her daily task
Life would be perfect and we’d all be blessed!

Hundreds of dewdrops to greet the dawn,
Hundreds of bees in the purple clover,
Hundreds of butterflies on the lawn,
But only one mother the wide world over.
