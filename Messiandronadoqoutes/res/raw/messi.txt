I thought love was just a mirage of the mind,
it's an illusion, it's fake, impossible to find.
But the day I met you, I began to see,
that love is real, and exists in me.
Happy Valentine Day!

8xxx8I asked God for a flower, he gave me a bouquet
I asked God for a minute, he gave me a day
I asked God for true love, he gave me that too
I asked for an angel and he gave me you.
Happy Valentine Day!

8xxx8I love your dark eyes,
And your curly hair,
I love your smile,
And the way that you care.
Happy Valentine Day!

8xxx8Every time I look at you
my heart skips a beat
I wonder if you know, my love,
that my heart is at your feet
I leave it there for you to do
whatever that you wish
You could take my heart,
and love me,
Or just leave me in this bliss.
Happy Valentine Day!

8xxx8I wrote your name in the sky,
but the wind blew it away.
I wrote your name in the sand,
but the waves washed it away.
I wrote your name in my heart,
and forever it will stay.
Happy Valentine Day!

Who makes my existence so complete. 
Should She get a Long-stemmed Rose?

For now, take my heart, and be My Valentine.

23)	You're Still a Valentine 
Once upon a time 
in ages past 
you had a heart 
you thought would last, 
But then it faded 
and now you're free 
and I hope 
it's you and me. 
A valentine 
from years gone by 
reminders from 
a bygone time, 
But on this day 
I bid to you 
sweet valentine 
from me to you.

24)	On this day made just for lovers 
something weighs heavily on my mind 
yet still I have to question~ 
Will you be my valentine? 
There will be no roses delivered 
no chocolates that taste divine 
yet none of that matters to me~ 
Will you be my valentine? 
There will be no jewelry received from you 
to me~ that suits me just fine 
all I want from you is your heart 
Will you be my valentine? 
On this day made just for lovers 
you'll give me your heart, I'll give you mine 
yet still I have to question 
Will you be my valentine?

25)	On Valentine's Day,
I'm thinking about
the special ways
you have made my life better.
The little things,
the not-so-little things...
Your kindness,
the way you always listen
and pay attention to me.
You make my world
brighter and richer.
You're a gift to me,
and I thank you
for being you.

26)	I think about you when I close my eyes 
And even when I open them in the morning. 
It may not be Valentine's Day everyday 
But with you. just know your 
My love supply. 
My Funny Valentine!

27)	Love can be expressed in many ways. One way I know is to send it across the distance to the person who is reading this.

28)	I ask God for a rose n he gave me flowers; 
I ask God for water n he gave me an ocean; 
I ask God for an angel n he gave me the best love ever!

29)	!!..LOVE..!!
L:- Love With All The Herat
o:- Overcome Problems To Gather
v:- Value Everything You Share
e:- Encourage Each Other

30)	Be my Valentine, my love,
As I will be for you,
And we will love the whole day long,
And love our whole lives through. 
For love has no parameters
And does not end with time,
But is the gift of paradise,
A pinch of the sublime.

31)	V-ortices within may drag you down.
A-nchor, then, in my serenity.
L-ove saves some who otherwise might drown,
E-mbarked alone upon their Galilee.
N-or should you deem your own love not enough
T-o be the chapel to which I retreat
I-n search of a pavilion for my pain.
N-o love is love unless it be a seat
E-nchanted, where a stone might weep again

32)	 U r unique
U r caring &
U r the best….
N I’m d luckiest to
Have U in my life!
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY MY SWEET HEART!

33)	What the heart gives away is never gone, but kept in the hearts of others, from dusk to dawn. Love you from the core of my heart. Be my Valentine.

34)	I searched through books & leafed through cards, 
For words that would convey, what I had in my heart, 
But when I sat down to write, all I can write was....I Love U!
Happy Valentine's Day!

35)	If there were no words
No way to speak
I would still here you
If there were no tears
No it to feel inside
I would still feel for you
And even if the sun refuse to shine
Even if all ends ran out Love
I would still have you here
Until the end of time
All I need is you as my VALENTINE.

36)	On Valentine's Day,
I'm thinking about
the special ways
you have made my life better.
The little things,
the not-so-little things...
Your kindness,
the way you always listen
and pay attention to me.
You make my world
brighter and richer.
You're a gift to me,
and I thank you
for being you.

37)	On this day made just for lovers
you'll give me your heart, I'll give you mine
yet still I have to question
Will you be my valentine?

38)	There will be no roses delivered
no chocolates that taste divine
yet none of that matters to me~
Will you be my valentine?

39)	If you were my valentine
I'd search the endless skies
to find the perfect starlight
that would compliment your eyes
and keep it in a wishing well
created just for you
and filled with my desires
to make all your dreams come true.

40)	YouRe So Far Way
Yet You Are Here
I CanT See Your Face
But I Can Feel You Near
I CanT Touch You
But I Hold You Close
No Matter Where You Are
YouRe In My Heart
Wherever I Go
Hopefully The Miles Between Us
Will Disappear Soon
Because All I Want
Is To Be With You
41)	Hard To Sleep, Just Thinking About You
Hard To Stay Awake, And Miss Dreaming About You.
All I Need Is You, To Put That Smile On My Face
All I Want Is You, To Keep Me Feeling This Way.
42)	There is something about you
Which makes me go crazy about you
All I want to do now, is to look into your eyes
put your hands in mine
and never let this time go.
There's nothing that we can't do
Just don't forget that
I LOVE YOU
43)	My valentine:
Why would I bring you chocolate
when you are the treat.
My valentine:
Why would I bring you flowers
when your smell is what's sweet.
My valentine:
Why would I buy you a card
when the words can be heard through me.
My valentine:
Why would I take you out some place
when all I need is to see your face.
My valentine:
Why would I celebrate this on one special day
When I can do it always.

44)	This may be a little silly,
But I have a question for you,
Will you be my valentine? 
'Cause no one else will do...
I know you are my boyfriend
But will you be my valentine?
I can't think of anyone else
I'd want to have as mine...
No one else gives me the tingles
The way you always do,
So, will you be my valentine?
So I can share this with you...
No one has ever kissed me
And sent chills down my spine,
Until the night you kissed me,
So, please be my valentine...
Like I said this is silly,
But I have one last question for you...
If you agree to be my valentine,
Can I be yours too?
45)	On Valentine's Day, the day of affection,
My thoughts naturally turn in your direction.
I think of many things, big and small
That you've given to me and given your all.
You see me always in the kindest light;
You're a glow in my life, golden and bright.
I'm thankful for the happy ties that bind
Me to you in our family, and I'd like to remind
You of all the special memories I treasure.
Having you in my life is nothing but pleasure!
You're a walking example of how to live,
How to share, how to teach, how to love, how to give.
46)	'Near ones r not dear'
'Dear ones r not near' It is easy
to remember the near ones.
But... Very difficult to forget the dear ones.
HAPPY Valentine's Day.
47)	On Valentine's Day we think about
Those matchless people who
Give extra meaning to our lives--
The very special few.
Without them, skies would turn to gray,
Things wouldn't be the same,
Life wouldn't be as colorful,
It would be a duller game,
And when I contemplate that group--
Friends and family who are mine,
I appreciate and treasure you,
You're essential, Valentine!
48)	Sweetheart!
u r so beautiful my love 4u will always b true,
here's a wish 4 my darling...
may all your dreams come true
i wish u a very happy birthday.
with lots of love and kisses...
from a heart that beats...
just 4 you by me.
49)	I love you each day more than before,
in return I don’t ask for anything more,
but hold my hand when days are dark,
and light my soul with your love’s spark,
give my heart strength to get through,
and love is all that I will need from you,
I may not have many fancy gifts to give,
but I’ll love you as long as we both shall live..!!
50)	Loving you
Means that I give you my heart
My love, my whole self;
You’ll always come first
Before anything else
Loving you
Means that I give you my faith
My trust, my confidence;
I promise to always be true
To be loyal, to be honest
Loving you
Means you’re a part of my life,
My dreams, my future;
You are a part of me
Now and forever
