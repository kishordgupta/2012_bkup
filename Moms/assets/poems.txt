My Sweet Mother
My mother is so sweet
Sweeter than all the sweets you eat'
She is Gentle and kind
and works by using her mind.
Her ears are sharp like a knife
and she is a perfect wife.
If someone is in need, oh dear
My sweet mother is always there.

Mom's Love
Mom's smiles can brighten any moment,
Mom's hugs put joy in all our days,
Mom's love will stay with us forever
and touch our lives in precious ways...
The values you've taught,

and the wonderful love you've shown,
have enriched my life
in more ways than I can count.
I Love you Mom!

Thank You Mom For Everything
How did you find the energy, Mom
To do all the things you did,
To be teacher, nurse and counselor
To me, when I was a kid.

How did you do it all, Mom,
Be a chauffeur, cook and friend,
Yet find time to be a playmate,
I just can't comprehend.

I see now it was love, Mom
That made you come whenever I'd call,
Your inexhaustible love, Mom
And I thank you for it all.

Mom…
You deserve much more than words can say;
You make me feel I always will pray,

“God, please, be with Mom in a special way.
Give her Your blessings throughout the day.
Show her the meaning, the reason for her to stay.
Let Your angels guard her; don’t let her go astray.
Help her see the good of Your work; keep the evil away.
Keep her smiling; dry her tears, if You may.
Let her that whenever there’s trouble,
She can turn to You; You’ll help her struggle.
Let her know that here on Earth,
She’ll never know what she’s really worth,
But up there, up there in Heaven,
She’s guarded by an angel, no, make that seven:

Three on her right to help her hold on tight,
Three on her left to help her have hope in the stars so bright,
And one in front of her to help her see the light, Your light…

Please, let her know how precious she is
In our hearts even if we’re not showing this.
Let her know we’re always there
To help her out through our prayer.
We may not feel what she’s passing through,
But let her know we try our best to do.
Let her know that whenever she’s down,
We can feel it without a frown.
Help us se Your goodness through her,
Through Your words wherever we were…”

That’s my prayer for you every night.
May this give you hope in everything in sight.
And please, know that wherever you are,
Know that we love you and care whether we’re near or far…

Mother…
When the night is gone, and the morning shines
I look at you with special eyes.
I see your face which always smiles.
I hear your voice which never dies.
I feel your hair which always flies
Across my cheeks, across my eyes.
I feel your hand which always dries
My happy tears and my sad cries…

My Fortune, My Mother
How much I love you I can't say:
It's more than words can hold.
You're all at once my rich, red clay,
My potter and my mold.
Yours the words that shaped my voice,
The spirit within mine.
Yours the will that shaped my choice,
My fortune, and my sign.

How lucky I was to have had you
At the core of me!
Wise and good, you always knew
Just what I could be.

And so I came to be someone
Whom I could be proud of.
For this I give my swollen sum
Of gratitude and love.

The Best mother that I LOVE
When God set the world in place,
when He hung the stars up in space,
when He made the land and the sea,
then He made you and me.
He sat back and saw all that was good,
He saw things to be as they should.
Just one more blessing He had in store;
He created a mother, but whatever for?
He knew a mother would have a special place
to shine His reflection on her child's face.
A mother will walk the extra mile
just to see her children smile.
She'll work her fingers to the bone
to make a house into a home.
A mother is there to teach and guide,
a mother will stay right by your side.
She'll be there through your pain and strife,
she'll stay constant in your life.
A mother will lend a helping hand
until you have the strength to stand.
She'll pick you up when you are down,
when you need a friend she'll stick around.
A mother is one who listens well,
will keep her word; will never tell.
A mother never pokes or pries
but stands quietly by your side,
giving you the strength you need,
encouraging you to succeed.
A mother is one who can be strong
when you need someone to lean on.
You're more than a mother to me;
a reflection of Him in your face I see,
a love that knows no boundaries.
I'm glad that you chose to be
all this and more to me.
You share a love that knows no end,
you're more than my mother,
you are my friend.

No Matter What I Do
No matter what I do.
You always stick with me.
When I’m down.
You pick me up.
You hug me.
You love me.
You tell me how to keep
My balance throughout life.
So I don’t fall down.
No one’s perfect.
Not me.
Not you.
But to me you’re as perfect as you’ll ever be.

My Mother
My mother is the dearest for me.
She loves me like an angel,
She serves me like a nurse.
She is the soul of our house;
She takes care of us.
She helps me to do my homework,
She prepares our breakfast.
She is a very kind and a loving mother,
I feel proud of my mother.
