    <string name="app_name">Top 10 Football teams Ever</string>
    <string name="share">One of the truly enthralling things about following football is the chance to watch the great teams at work.
Whether it be in domestic football or on the international stage, we have been blessed to see some truly unforgettable teams over the last century.
We know picking a top 50 will always be contentious, and we know you will want to have your say . we welcome it. 
Perhaps you have a favourite team from British football . maybe Manchester United\'s treble winners from 1999, Liverpool\'s 1984 vintage or Celtic\'s Lisbon Lions?
It could be that one of the great European club sides will top your list, the great Real Madrid or AC Milan teams?
Or maybe its one of those special international teams that have graced our summers down the years . Brazil\'s magical stars of 1970 or Holland and their total footballers? 
We haven\'t only selected teams on strength of trophies alone . there\'s more to the game than that. Style, panache and skill are all characteristics that any true lover of football will recognise and appreciate...
